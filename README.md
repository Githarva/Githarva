- 👋 Heyo! I’m <strong> @Githarva </strong>
- 👀 A full-time Physical Therapist by day and a hobbyist programmer by night, I have started teaching myself through Harvards CS50x, Mimo and FCC, joined GitHub to hopefully find fun ways to apply my knowledge and browse other people's projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the basics of the popular languages and plan to apply them in a fun little personal project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end web development and design projects.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out via local GitHub messages! <br> PS: I am broke so don't waste your time spamming ads.
